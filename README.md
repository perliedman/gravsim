# GravSim

An _extremely_ crude gravitational simulator I hacked together
to teach my kids about gravity and our solar system (and also
trick them to write some code).

## Using

Open `index.html` in your favourite browser. Marvel at the
planets spinning around the sun.

## Modifying

No user interface. Edit `index.js` to your delight. Create
three body problems etc.
